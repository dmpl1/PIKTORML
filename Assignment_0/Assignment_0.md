 **What is the definition of Machine Learning according to Arthur Samuel?**

Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as a "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".


**What is the definition of Machine Learning according to Tom Mitchell?**

As per Tom Mitchell - "Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience". 

**Example to understand ML**

In practice, the patterns that a computer (machine learning system) learns can be very complicated and difficult to explain. Consider searching for dog images on Google search — as seen on the image below, Google is incredibly good at bringing relevant results, yet how does Google search achieves this task? In simple terms, Google search first gets a large quantity of examples (image dataset) of photos labeled “dog” — then the computer (machine learning system) looks for patterns of pixels and patterns of colors that will help it guess (predict) if the image queried it is indeed a dog.

At first, Google’s computer makes a random guess of what patterns are good as to identify an image of a dog. If it makes a mistake, then a set of adjustments are made in order for the computer to get it right. In the end, such collection of patterns will be learned by a large computer system modeled after the human brain (deep neural network), that once is trained can correctly identify and bring accurate results of dog images on Google search, along with anything else that you could possibly think of —such process is called the training phase of a machine learning system.

Imagine that you were in charge of building a machine learning prediction system to try and identify images between dogs and cats. The first step would be to gather a large quantity of labeled images with “dog” for dogs and “cat” for cats. Second, we would train the computer to look for patterns on the images as to identify dogs and cats respectively.
Once the machine learning model has been trained. we can throw at it (input) different images to see if it can correctly identify dogs and cats.A trained machine learning model can (most of the time) correctly identify such queries.
